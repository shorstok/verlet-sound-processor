Sound processing using Verlet integrator
=========

Simulates sound transfer through simple physical medium (consisting of springs and rigid bodies mostly) using Verlet integrator. 
Input file waveform is transformed into simulated 'effector' movements, which in turn affect simulated model particles. 
Resulting (output) sound is captured through movements of 'sensor' entity and is saved as an output wavefile.
